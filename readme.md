Example
1.Suppose you are 34 years old with a gross annual income of 40 Lakhs, no extra income, and no deductions. The calculation would be as follows:

Age: 34

Gross Annual Income: 40 Lakhs

Extra Income: 0 Lakhs

Deductions: 0 Lakhs
Tax = 0.3 * (40 - 8) = 9.6 Lakhs
Hence total amount will be 3040000

2.Suppose you are 38 years old with a gross annual income of 10 Lakhs, no extra income, and no deductions. The calculation would be as follows:

Age: 38

Gross Annual Income: 10 Lakhs

Extra Income: 0 Lakhs

Deductions: 0 Lakhs
Tax = 0.3 * (10 - 8) = 0.6 Lakhs
Hence total amount will be 940000

3.Suppose you are 55 years old with a gross annual income of 30 Lakhs. The calculation would be as follows:

Age: 55

Gross Annual Income: 30 Lakhs
